The input L is used to control whether the data stored in the register is updated with the value of w or the value of R. When L is high, the output Q is updated with the value of R. When L is low, the output Q is updated with the value of w.  The module is implemented using an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. The always block contains a conditional statement that checks the value of the L input. If L is high, the output Q is updated with the value of R. If L is low, the output Q is updated with the value of w. If E is low, the output Q is held in its current state."}
